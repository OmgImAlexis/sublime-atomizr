Convert Sublime Text completions into Atom snippets, and vice versa.

This package is also available for [Atom](https://github.com/idleberg/atom-atomizr) and as an even more powerful [Ruby script](https://github.com/idleberg/atomizr).

## Installation

### Package Control

1. Make sure you already have [Package Control](https://packagecontrol.io/) installed
2. Choose *“Install Package”* from the Command Palette (<kbd>Super</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>p</kbd>)
3. Type *“Atomizr”* and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>
4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 to install *“Better CoffeeScript”* (recommended)

With [auto_upgrade](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control/settings/) enabled, Package Control will keep all installed packages up-to-date!

### Manual installation

Since [package dependencies](https://packagecontrol.io/docs/dependencies) are handled by Package Control, manual installation is not advised!

## Usage

The [Command Palette](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/reference/command_palette.html) currently offers the following commands, each prefixed with “Atomizr”:

* Automatic conversion
* Convert Sublime Text to Atom (completions)
* Convert Sublime Text to Atom (snippet)
* Convert Atom to Sublime Text

Since automatic conversion is based on scope, make sure the [Better CoffeeScript](https://packagecontrol.io/packages/Better%20CoffeeScript) package is installed as well.
